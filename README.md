# Wordbreaker
### A simple game to guess a random word.

## Launch instructions
You can build wordbreaker on your local machine using `npm start`.  This will populate a Mongo database with words and assign those words to categories.  If you'd like to customize your own lists, you can add files to `public/data_files`.  The filename will be used to create the category, and each word you want added should be listed on a new line.

This process will also start the game server.  Now you can navigate to localhost:3000 to play the game.

## Game instructions
Gameplay instructions can be read in game by clicking 'show rules' in the upper right hand corner.
